# Hello, I'm James. I build things.
I'm what you'd call a "software engineer" it's a fancy way of describing what I often do (and also linkedin 
likes it) although, I do believe that this is chemist and poetry because most of the time we're speaking nonsense 
and blowing things up.

##### About building things
One of my strongest skills is certainly the hability to make things up, I'm not talking about lies (even 
tho almost all my predictions end up being one) I really like imagining things from the ground up, defining patterns 
and sticking to them when suitabe and desirable. Also I like people, engaging with, building togheter and more importantly, actually 
solving real world people's problems through technology.

##### What stack I'm intertwined in?

> Even tho bash is cited above, I mostly do windows shit because of daily usage and It's what im mostly 
confortable with (visual studio IDE and the whole microsofðŸ’– paraphernalia included). Though I am currently experimenting with advanced linux server 
operations and more computation specialized stuff.

I do Love dotnet and most of the things that I do are supported by the rich .NET ecosystem. I 
am aproaching a more low level way of building software and slowly moving to things like C or Rust but 
not a reality in the foreseeable future.
